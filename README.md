Hi! I'm **Vural**, a Full Stack Developer who has been creating bots for quite some time. Recently, I’ve stepped back from active bot development, but I still enjoy helping friends or anyone who wants to get a bot up and running.

### Bot Setup & Pricing
I will set up the bot for you **as long as you provide a VDS**. I don’t charge extra for installation—my main goal is just to make it work smoothly for you.

If you’re interested, just reach out and we can get your bot online quickly!
